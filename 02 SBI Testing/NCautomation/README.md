# NETCONF Automation

A software to automatically run NETCONF tests against network elements.

The purpose of this tool is to get a test case or bunch of RPCs (either provided by the vendor or generated 
by us), using them to interact with the network elements and generate reports with the state of the tests. 

## Dependencies

This software depends on NCCclient library:
* Github <https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient>
* PyPI: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ncclient>
